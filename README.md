# Tab-Manager-Pro
Firefox addon to help YOU manage your out of control tabs!
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/2wkex-YEWO8
#### Description:
This is a firefox addon. You can install it on chrome using this repo! https://github.com/Explodey-Wolf/Tab-Manager-Pro-Chrome 
The purpose is simple. If you get too many tabs open, default of 20(configurable), you can then open up a tab manager to help you clean up! It shows tabs in a list type view. You can select multiple items with control, one item with no modifiers, and a line of items with shift clicks. Press Escape to deselect, and Delete to close tabs. Right click to open up a context menu to close and move to a new window. Closed tabs can be reopened like normal. Clicking the extension icon opens up a menu where you are able to configure the amount of tabs the warning opens up as, and open up the tab manager.


This project was made as a final project for the Harvard CS50. Note that opening a New Tab into a new window does not work, and will just ignore it. Opening a new window with no tabs will just open a window with one tab. Happy browsing!
